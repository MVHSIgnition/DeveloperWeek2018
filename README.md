EZ Goal is a social media centered around goals. Users set a personal goal for themselves (e.g. workout everyday for 10 minutes), and other friends can cheer their friends on. Users get coins after completing a resolution, which can be used for free trials with partnered companies (who are getting free advertising as users use their apps to track their goals as well).
